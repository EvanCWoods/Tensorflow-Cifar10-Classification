# Tensorflow-Cifar10-Classification

This project aims to use convolutional naeural networks to understand and accurately predict on the cifar-10 dataset. The point at which the project is successful is when a model achieves a 95% validation accuracy and is able to predict on images from outside the dataset with high accuracy. The way that I will test multiple architectures to find the best one is through keras-tuner which automates the testing processs by trying every possible combination of hyperparameters that I provide in teh script.
